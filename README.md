# hardin_shapes
A simple webpage that has a few shapes moving around from my CS 559 course

The program will build 4 shapes in a canvas and slowly rotate them, refreshing the page will change the color of the shapes.

Easily buildable (just download all files and run index.html)

FILES MADE BY ALEJANDRO:
